🌍 What is Plastiphalt?

Plastiphalt = Plastic + Asphalt.
It’s a sustainable road construction technique where waste plastics are blended into the asphalt mix to improve strength, durability, and reduce plastic pollution.

Instead of burning or dumping plastic waste, shredded plastics are melted and coated on hot aggregates before bitumen is added. This enhances binding strength, reduces potholes, and improves road lifespan.

🛠 How the Process Works (Step by Step)

Plastic Collection & Sorting

Plastics like HDPE, LDPE, PP, PET, PS are collected.

PVC & Other toxic plastics are excluded (the code explicitly removes them).

Plastic Shredding

Plastics are shredded into small chips (~2–4 mm).

This increases surface area for coating.

Heating Aggregates

Road aggregates (stone, gravel, sand) are heated to about 160–170°C (MIX_TEMP_C in your code).

At this temperature, plastics melt but do not burn.

Plastic Coating

Shredded plastics are mixed with hot aggregates.

The melted plastics coat the aggregate surface, making them water-resistant and improving binding.

Adding Bitumen

Hot bitumen (~160°C) is added to the plastic-coated aggregates.

This creates Plastiphalt mix (bitumen + plastic-coated aggregate).

Laying the Road

The mix is laid and compacted like normal asphalt.

The result: stronger, more durable, water-resistant roads.

📊 How the Code Simulates This (Your suggest_mix function)

Your Python code mimics the engineering process by:

Plastic Weight Targeting

Ensures 6–10% of bitumen weight is plastic (PLASTIC_PERCENT_RANGE = (0.06, 0.10)).

Example: For 1000 kg bitumen, use 60–100 kg plastic.

Plastic Allocation

Different plastics (HDPE, LDPE, PP, PET, PS) are given weights based on road severity:

High severity roads (high traffic, heavy loads) → More HDPE & PP (strong plastics).

Low severity roads → More LDPE, PET (flexible plastics).

Available Stock Constraint

Only allocates from the actual plastics available (available_kg input).

If there’s less plastic than required, it scales down proportionally.

Aggregate-to-Bitumen Ratio

Uses a standard ratio (default 10:1) → if 1000 kg bitumen, need 10,000 kg aggregate.

Durability Score

Combines:

Plastic composition strength (comp_index)

Traffic factor (traffic_adt)

Severity factor (low/medium/high road stress)

Climate penalty (very hot/cold climates reduce performance).

→ Gives a score between 0 and 1 predicting road durability.

Output

Batch design (bitumen, aggregate, plastic allocation by type).

Plastic % of bitumen.

Recommended mix temperature (160–170°C).

Expected durability score.

Notes for operators.

✅ Real-World Benefits

Stronger roads (higher Marshall stability).

Waterproofing (resists potholes during monsoon).

Eco-friendly (reduces plastic waste).

Cost savings (less bitumen needed, longer life).

⚡ In short:
Your project is a digital twin of the Plastiphalt process → it takes traffic, climate, road severity, and plastic availability, and designs the optimal mix for durable eco-friendly roads.
